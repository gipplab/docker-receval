1013320,Selected chapters in the analytic theory of ordinary differential equations. (Izbrannye glavy analiticheskoj teorii obyknovennykh differentsial’nykh uravnenij.),"n the book under review, the author gives a comprehensive exposition of the analytic theory of linear differential equations of Fuchsian type. It is written in a classical style, starting from Hilbert’s XXIst problem and Schwartz’ differential equations for mappings of circular polygons and also covering the hypergeometric equation and its generalizations, Legendre’s equation, Heun’s equation and other.",,1,34-01
7012554,Numerical solution of Heun equation via linear stochastic differential equation. (English),"A special type of an ordinary differential equation, called a hypergeometric Heun equation, is considered. This is converted into a stochastic differential equation, which in turn, is solved numerically. Comparisons with exact solutions for benchmark problems are presented. Asymptotic stability, expectation and variance of solutions of the equation are also studied.",1432.65101,0,65L10
4002585,Fuchsian differential equations. With special emphasis on Gauss-Schwarz theory. (English),"The author studies linear ordinary differential equations and systems of linear partial differential equations with finite dimensional solution spaces in the complex analytic category, concentrating exclusively on the Gauss-Schwarz theory of the hypergeometric differential equation. This theory is presented as part of the theory of orbifolds, i.e. to each orbifold uniformized by a symmetric space, one attempts to associate a uniformizing differential equation. In order to construct orbifolds, recent results of R. Kobayashi are used in a crucial way. Thus new Fuchsian differential equations in two variables with remarkable properties are constructed. Part I covers hypergeometric differential equations, the Riemann and Riemann-Hilbert problems, Schwarzian derivatives and the Gauss-Schwarz theory for equations in one variables in chapters 1 to 5 respectively. Chapters 6 to 10 of Part II does the same for equations in several variables. Ch. 11 deals with reflection groups and ch. 12 presents new differential equations.",618.35001,35,35-02
4095898,Reduction of single Fuchsian differential equations to hypergeometric systems. (English)," linear ordinary differential equation which has only regular singular points in the extended complex plane is called a Fuchsian equation. A Fuchsian equation written as pn(t)y(n)=pn−1(t)y(n−1)+...+p0(t)y,pn(t)y(n)=pn−1(t)y(n−1)+...+p0(t)y, (′=d/dt)(′=d/dt) is called a hypergeometric equation if pnpn is a polynomial of t of degree exactly n and every pipi (i=n−1,...,1)(i=n−1,...,1) is a polynomial of t of degree at most i. It is easy to see that every Fuchsian equation can be reduced to a hypergeometric equation. We call a system of differential equations (t−B)dx/dt=Ax(t−B)dx/dt=Ax introduced by K. Okubo the hypergeometric system. Here x is a column n- vector, B=diag(b1,...,bn)B=diag(b1,...,bn) and A is an n by n constant matrix. The authors present an algorithm to reduce every hypergeometric equation to a hypergeometric system and a program of an algebraic manipulation for this algorithm by using Computer-VA11/785, OS-UNIX4.3BSD, Language-REDUCE 3. They also give a method to transform every system of hypergeometric partial differential equations of two variables x and y given by Appell and Horn into a system of total differential equations and to obtain a single ordinary differential equation restricted on x or y section.",669.34012,0,34M99
1238007,Algebro-geometric aspects of SS-duality. (English. Russian original),"The author describes three series of algebro-geometric models for super Yang-Mills quantum field theories in dimension four. Then the SS-duality conjecture is related to the modularity of generating functions of characteristic numbers of moduli spaces of stable bundles on algebraic surfaces. In this context, the finiteness condition for the number of of solutions of field equation is discussed; in one case, it turns out that the invariants of the moduli space should satisfy the Markov equation x2+y2+z2=3xyzx2+y2+z2=3xyz.",1084.14503,0,14D20
7121432,On rank two algebro-geometric solutions of an integrable chain.,Summary: In this paper we consider a differential-difference system which is equivalent to the commutativity condition of two differential-difference operators. We study the rank two algebro-geometric solutions of this system.,1423.39006,1,39A12
5046302,Towards algebro-geometric integration of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. (English),Summary: We are discussing various possibilities to construct algebro-geometric solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on the basis of application of the apparatus of completely integrable systems and theory of Abelian functions. In this context algebro-geometric solutions of Schrödinger equation with finite-gap potential were considered as well the solutions in trigonal Abelian functions of the two-component vector nonlinear Schrödinger equation (or Manakov system).,1101.35381,0,35Q55
1413172,On commuting differential operators. (English),"Let FF be an ordinary differential field of characteristic 00, DD be a differentiation of FF, CC be its field of constants and R=F[D]R=F[D] be a ring of linear differential operators over FF(in other terms a skew polynomial ring). The author discusses in the paper operators from RR which have certain symmetry properties (so-called algebro-geometric expressions). Roughly speaking (Burchnall-Chaundy theorem), L∈R∖FL∈R∖F is algebro-geometric if the centralizer ZR(L)ZR(L) is not standard (i.e. ZR(L)≠C[M]ZR(L)≠C[M] for some M∈RM∈R). G. M. Bergman [Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 137, 327-344 (1969; Zbl 0175.31501)] proved that for a free algebra over kk (related closely with a skew polynomial ring) any such centralizer is a polynomial ring of one indeterminate over kk. Thus the existence of algebro-geometric elements isn’t an ordinary phenomenon. But when FF is a strongly normal extension of CC such elements exist. For example, L=D2−2/x2L=D2−2/x2 is a simplest algebro-geometric operator over F=C(x)F=C(x). I. Schur showed [Berl. Math. Ges. Sitzungsber. 4, 2-8 (1904; JFM 36.0387.01)] that a centralizer of any element L∈RFL∈RF is commutative. So a study of algebro-geometric operators of RR is equivalent to a study of commutative subrings of RR. The author obtains for the cases F=C(x)F=C(x) and F=C(exp(2πx/p))F=C(exp⁡(2πx/p)) the following main result (theorem 1): Suppose that the coefficients of the differential expressionL=Dn+qn−2Dn−2+⋯+q0L=Dn+qn−2Dn−2+⋯+q0are either rational functions, which are bounded at infinity, or else meromorphic, simply periodic functions with period pp, which remain bounded as ∣Im(x/p)∣∣Im⁡(x/p)∣ tends to infinity. If, regardless of z∈Cz∈C, all solutions to the differential equation Ly=zyLy=zy are meromorphic then LL is algebro-geometric. We note that according to K. Yosida’s result [Jap. J. Math. 9, 231-232 (1933; Zbl 0007.20801)] the linear differential operators over C(x)C(x) satisfying conditions of theorem 1 have a fundamental system of solutions ( not just one solution) of the formr(x)exp(λx)(λ∈C,r(x)∈C(x)).r(x)exp⁡(λx)(λ∈C,r(x)∈C(x)).So these operators are just equivalent (over C(x)C(x)) to the operators with constant coefficients. Then the author proves that if the family of equations Ly=zyLy=zy permits a general solution of special kind then LL is algebro-geometric. Using this solution one can easily receive a linear system of differential equations the solvability of which in FF means that the operator LL is algebro-geometric.",953.34073,4,34M05
